# Dane-County-Presidential-Election-Data


## Synopsis

The goal of this project is to get an idea of voter turnout by city/town/village in Dane County for each of the past presidential elections.


## Output
Current output is <a href="https://github.com/kfish15/Dane-County-Presidential-Election-Data">Workbook1</a>, which holds a sheet for Population of town/city/village according to the 2000 census, and sheets for cumulative votes for each presidential candidate in each election by city/town/village.  

Next steps are to:
1) Write tests to ensure the edits I made preserved the accuracy and validity of the data
2) Write cleaner, more understandable code. Also see if anything can be condensed. 
3) Gain a better understanding of R, and create an R dataset
